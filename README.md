  Hello, my name is Jamal Person, and this is my first time using GitHub for my curriculum. I’ve heard of GitHub while at FAMU, but never used it until your class, Ms. Coote. This fall and spring semester will be my last year for a bachelor’s degree in computer science, and I hope to make the best out of this opportunity. I live in Port Saint Lucie, Florida. I was born in California, but moved to Virginia, then moved and grew up in Florida. I like visiting family in Miami, spending time with them, and caring deeply about them. My hobbies include playing video games, reading manga, and watching anime. I originally got into computer science because of video games, and I hope one day I can create a video game for Nintendo. I hope to learn from you and make the most of learning the skills you teach me during this semester.
